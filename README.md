## Input 
Input is the way the computer gets information from the user 

Note: Python initially treats input as a `string` type

Ex. 

5 --> "5"

Today is Monday --> "Today is Monday"

### Formula: 
`VariableName = input("PROMPT")`

PROMPT - a question or statement that the computer asks the user 

Python stores the __input__ in the __variableName__
